This is the final project of CSCC43 Summer 2014 in UTSC

1. Purpose of the project:
You are hired by a pizza chain (Pizzas R'Us!) to design, analyze, implement, document and demostrate a database system for ordering and delivering pizzas.

2. Overview:
The pizza delivery system will support purchasing pizzas from a local store through an interface and delivery of the purchased merchandise to the customer's address. The orders will be placed for a "delivery window" during which the customer will be home to receive goods. You are to analyze and make strategic decisions whether your system should support a window as tight as that of ordering with guaranteed delivery in XX minutes or less. This decision can have significant impact on the business merit of the system.
